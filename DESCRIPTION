Description: Genomic coordinates of problematic genomic regions as GRanges, 
    previously known as blacklisted or exclusion regions (ENCODE data). Includes 
    GRanges of various genome gaps, such as centromeres, telomeres, known 
    heterochromatin regions, etc. (UCSC 'gap' table data). Primarily for human 
    and mouse genomes, hg19/hg38 and mm9/mm10 genome assemblies.
